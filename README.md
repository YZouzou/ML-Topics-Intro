# Introductory Notebooks to ML Related Topics
Coding algorithms and visualizing mathematical concepts helps a lot in the learning process. Here are some of the notebooks I created while learning ML related topics. Most notebooks contain interactive visualizations. In order to view the interactive content, you can either follow the provided Google Colab links, or download the notebooks and view them on Jupyter Notebooks.

### Gaussian Distributions
This notebook contains functions that plot 1D and 2D Gaussian distributions. The goal is to understand how a probability density function (PDF) is created, and to visualize Gaussians and see how they change in space given different parameters.

### Linear and Ridge Regression
In this notebook, I briefly introduce linear and Ridge (L2 regularized) regression and create functions for both regression methods. Then, I plot the cost function of Ridge regression for univariate and bivariate case. The goal is to visualize the effect of the regularizer on the total cost function.

### Lasso (L1) Regularization
In this notebook, I briefly introduce Lasso (L1) regularization and create a function that finds linear regression coefficients using L1 regularized least squares method. Then, I plot the cost function of Lasso regularized LS linear regression for univariate and bivariate case. The notebook also contains an interactive comparison between L1 and L2 regularized cost functions.

### Regularization Paths of L1 and L2 Regularized Cost Functions
In this notebook, the changes in linear regression coefficient values according to $\delta^{2}$ values is visualized for L2 and L1 regularizers. The effect of $\delta^{2}$ values on train and test error is also visualized.

### Polynomial Regression
In this notebook, linear regression using polynomial features is applied and visualized. The effect of adding a regularizer to the least squares function on over-fitting is visualized.
