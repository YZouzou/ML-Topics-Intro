# Introductory Notebooks to ML Related Topics
Coding algorithms and visualizing mathematical concepts helps a lot in the learning process. Here are some of the notebooks I created while learning ML related topics.

### Gaussian Distributions
This notebook contains functions that plot 1D and 2D Gaussian distributions. The goal is to understand how a probability density function (PDF) is created, and to visualize Gaussians and see how they change in space given different parameters.

### Linear and Ridge Regression
In this notebook, I briefly introduce linear and Ridge (L2 regularized) regression and create functions for both regression methods. Then, I plot the cost function of Ridge regression for univariate and bivariate case. The goal is to visualize the effect of the regularizer on the total cost function.
